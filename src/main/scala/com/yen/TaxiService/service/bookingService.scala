/**
 *
 * You are tasked to implement a simple taxi booking system in a 2D grid world with the following criteria:
 *
 * - The 2D grid world consists of `x` and `y` axis that each fit in a 32 bit integer, i.e. `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`.
 * - There are **3** cars in the system, All three cars should have id `1`, `2` and `3` respectively and initial start location is at origin `(0, 0)`. Note that you can store the car states in memory and there is no need for persistent storage for this exercise.
 * - A car travels through the grid system will require **1 time unit** to move along the `x` or `y` axis by **1 unit** (i.e. Manhattan distance). For example
 *   - Car at `(0, 0)` will reach `(0, 2)` in 2 time units.
 *   - Car at `(1, 1)` will reach `(4, 4)` in 6 time units.
 *   - More than 1 car can be at the same point at any time.
